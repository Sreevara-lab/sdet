###Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.###
listOne = [5, 6]
listTwo = [1,2,3]


print("First List ", listOne)
print("Second List ", listTwo)

# Declare a third list that will contain the result
thirdList = []

# Iterate through first list to get odd elements
for num in listOne:
    if (num % 2 != 0):
        thirdList.append(num)
        
# Iterate through first list to get even elements
for num in listTwo:
    if (num % 2 == 0):
        thirdList.append(num)

# Print result
print("result List is:")
print(thirdList)
